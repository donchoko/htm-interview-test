# HTM Interview test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements
- Load the properties from the specified JSON file and render them in the page.

- It is expected that at least the name and description of each property are visible.

- Filtering:
  
  - The page should have a text input to allow users to filter the properties.
  
  - When the text is entered in the field, the displayed properties should be filtered by name or description.
  
  - If no properties are displayed, due to filtering, then display a corresponding error message.
 
## Tools

- React Router
- Eslint
